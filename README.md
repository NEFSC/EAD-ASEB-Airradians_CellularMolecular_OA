## Cellular-Molecular OA response

**OBJECTIVE:**


**TIMELINE:**


### F0 to F2 summary

#### Summer 2021

- F0 Bay scallops from CT spawned, exposed to 400 and 800 uatm pCO2 at 4 hours post-fertilization

#### Summer 2021 to Summer 2022

- F1 Bay scallops exposed to sample pCO2 condition for the totality of their lifespan

#### Summer 2022

- the two pCO2 cohorts were spawned and F2 Bay scallops were reared under thier matched parental-offspring condition (400 x 400 uatm and 800 x 800 uatm, parental x offspring)

#### late-Summer 2022

- at settlement stage, the 400 x 400 uatm F2 cohort was split to begin rearing animals under 1200 uatm (severe condition)

#### late-Summer 2022 to Spring 2023

- three F2 Bay scallop cohorts reared under the low (400 uatm), moderately-elevated (800 uatm), and severely elevated (1200 uatm) pCO2 levels continuously

### Reexposure experiment with F2 Adults

#### March 23rd 2023

- 90 F2 Adult Bay scallop Airradians were tagged, 30 from each of the pCO2 cohort and position back into their treatment tanks

####    Apri 24th 2023  

- Tagged Adults arranged in three tanks at each pCO2 conditions as the following:

  | pCO2 level | tank 1 | tank 2 |	tank 3 |
  | ----| --- | --- | --- |
  | 400 uatm | #1-10 | #11-20 | #21-30 |
  | 800 uatm | #31-40 | #41-50 | #51-60 |
  | 1200 uatm | #61-70 | #71-80 | #81-90 |

#### 	April 26th 2023

– pre experiment chemistry full  carbonate chem

#### May 1st 2023

– move animals into the treatments:

 NOTE! notice we have 10 tagged animals per tank!

####  May 2nd 2023:

- timepoint 1, destructively sample half of the animals (45 total) *paying close attention* to acquiring 5 animals per treatment

- full carbonate chemistry for all 9 tanks

 NOTE! we will sample half of the animals from each tank, leaving 5 remaining.

**Remove the following animals for destructive sampling**

  | pCO2 level | tank 1 | tank 2 |	tank 3 |
  | ----| --- | --- | --- |
  | 400 uatm | #s 1, 31, 32, 33, 61  | #s 4, 35, 64, 65, 66  | #s 7, 8, 9, 38, 68  |

####  May 9th 2023:

- mid-point carbonate chemistry for 3 tanks, 1 representative of each treatment 	


####  May 16th 2023:

- timepoint 2, destructively sample the remaining  animals (45 total)

**Remove the following animals for destructive sampling**
