## About HOBO sensor data 

* one sensor positioned in a single tank for each pH treatment (N = 3 sensors) 

* measured temperature (Celcius) and pH (as NBS scale and in millivolts) alongside timestamp

* data every 15 minutes from 4/27/2023 - 6/25/2023 

* all sensors were calibrated prior to use

	- note: the pH 7 hobo recorded near -0.1 relative to the pH 7.5 hobo suggesting the glass electrode was getting old 
	
* relevant dates are as follows:

	- (1) Immediate pre-exposure data: 4/27 (start of data post calibration) - 5/1 
	
	- (2) Exposure data: 5/1 (afternoon) - 5/16
