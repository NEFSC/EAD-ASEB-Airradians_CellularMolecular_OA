ATP assays run on 2023 august 28, 
Notes: Snap frozen gill tissues were aliquoted (~10mg) from the whole gill snap frozen on the 
experiment days. The remaining sample placed BACK at -80C for MDA assays 
(2) correct for total protein from the supernatant set asside after homogenization of this same sample 
(3) part way through sampling/dissections - Lisa Guy noticed that we did not have 90 samples in the freezzer
turned out the dewar on day 14 was not sufficiently emptied and we are missing ~50% of the samples from that day 
Katie S. unloaded the dewar and counted all gill samples that were then trashed (sad face) 
(4) we ran out of reaction mix up to plate 1 H7, therfore plate 1 H8-H12 and plate 2 A1, A2, B1, B2 were run 
with reagent from the second kit (aside from Assay buffer!, only one bottle used) 

We have two runs with plate 1 becasue the values differed, look at these to determine if we should correct for 
Plate 2 - the reason bein that the full 30 minute incubation might have bene early for the second reagent that was added.
