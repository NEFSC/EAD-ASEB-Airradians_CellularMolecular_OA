**About**: descriptions for the contencts within the folder 

### FlowCytometry data folder

**About**: all data measured in live hemolymph extractions from 90 Adult F2 Bay scallops in May 2023. 45 measured on timepoint Day 1 of the experiment (5/2/2023) and 45 on timepoint Day 14 of the experiment (5/26/2023)

- C6_templates = .cit files compatible with the BD C6 flow cytometer. Note that these templates were the baseline 
used to aquire the data, however *do not* reflect the exact cytograms for the hemolymph data 

- IMPORTANT: the data is located on .ci files or 'workspaces' - each too large to upload to github. These can be found on the google drive 
and the work/personnal laptops

- 'hemolymph'.csv files = these are the cumulative output of raw data from the .ci files, this is what we will import into R for statistical analysis
